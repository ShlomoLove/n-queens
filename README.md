# n-queens
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project makes use of algorithms to determine the how many different configurations of queens and rooks can be placed on a chess board without any of the pieces able to attack another piece on the board. The tests test for board sizes of 0x0 up to a 8x8 board. The project utilized pair programming.
